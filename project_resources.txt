Smart Parking System - Resources

This system uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to detect the availability of a parking spot and its adjacent spots. The ESP32 microcontroller gathers distance data and sends it to Ubidots while also hosting a web-based radar interface.

🧰 Hardware Components:
1. ESP32 Development Board
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
3. Servo Motor (SG90 or similar)
4. Breadboard
5. Jumper Wires

💻 Software Resources:
- Arduino framework for ESP32
- Libraries used:
  - WiFi.h
  - HTTPClient.h
  - ESP32Servo.h
  - WebServer.h

🌐 Cloud Platform:
- Ubidots (for real-time data monitoring)

🧠 Features:
- Servo rotates the ultrasonic sensor to scan surroundings.
- Web dashboard shows live radar-like visualization.
- Distance data is uploaded to Ubidots every 3 seconds.
