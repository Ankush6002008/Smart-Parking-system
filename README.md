# Smart-Parking-system
Our Smart Parking System is designed to efficiently monitor the availability of a specific parking spot as well as its adjacent spaces. At the heart of this system is an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on top of a servo motor. This setup allows the sensor to rotate and scan the surroundings, instead of being fixed in one direction.

As the servo moves, the ultrasonic sensor checks the distance to nearby objects at multiple angles. By interpreting this distance data, the system can intelligently determine whether the target parking spot and the adjacent spots are occupied or free.

This rotational scanning approach:

1.Maximizes coverage with just one sensor

2.Minimizes cost and hardware complexity

3.Provides real-time parking availability updates

The system can be integrated with a cloud dashboard or app to guide drivers to available spaces, reducing congestion and wait times.
